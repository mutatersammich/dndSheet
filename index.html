          <h1>Tyr's Appearance</h1>
          <p>Tyr is small, scrawny and sickly looking, although not actually ill.
          He puts off a friendy aura, his eyes are kind and enticing.
          His skin is as pale as a sheet, as if he has never seen the light of day.
          He tends to keep his tail wraped up around his waist so it is barely noticable. </p>

          <h1>Tyr's Backstory</h1>
          <p>Tyr never knew his parents, His early memories bring him back to the orphanage located
          in the south. It was a run-down place, but the people taking care of him seemed kind enough.
          he remained there until the age of 5, spending his days with the other orphans and learning
          basic arithmetic and language.<br>
          One day a tall robed woman came into the orphanage looking to adopt some of the children.
          she seemed kind yet reserved and had a great presence about her.
          The owners of the orphanage seemed to greatly respect this woman, and kindly introduced her
          to all of the children. Her name was Karel javascript(under revision)
          She seemed quite fond of two children in particular, Tyr and (insert friends name).<br>
          Tyr didn't know what this mysterious woman saw in him and felt undeserving of her attention.
          Yet, Tyr could sense her kind heart and affection towards him. <br>
          The tall mysterious woman adopted Tyr and (insert friends name) and brought them to her home.
          Karel's home was filled with wonderous magical things. Floating lights, books that seemed to endlessly
          flow from one end of a bookcase to the other, and a silent place of study where no sound could be heard
          once inside and no sound could be heard from outside the study.
          Karel wanted students, people she cared about that she could teach her vast knowledge to. <br>
          Tyr spent his days studying the arcane arts with his friend. Karel would always push them to learn
          all they could and practice regularly in the study room.
          Soon the two students would learn much and become quite experienced in the arcane. <br>
          always eager to learn more and more and to gain an edge on his fellow student, Tyr went into Karels
          private collection of magical tomes. A collection that Karel expressed they would only have access to
          by asking first, and being supervised while doing so. <br>
          Ignoring his mentors advice, Tyr dove right in to the private collection, trying to learn all he could.
          Tyr came across a very old worn tome, dark purple with glyphs all across it. It seemed especially isolated
          from the other books, almost hidden.
          A chill fell over Tyr as he picked up this dusty worn tome, as if the power within was stretching over his body.
          Tyr exitedly opened the Tome and was sudenly taken aback by what happened next. <br>
          the room he was in desolved around him, as he was taken to a place of darkness and incoprehensible beings.
          the physical laws seemingly did not abide in this realm. The alien creatures in this realm contacted him
          and told him many secrets of the universe. He spent what seemed like aeons in this realm.
          Karel returned home to find Tyr lost in this Ancient tome. She closed the book and in an instant Tyr was
          brought back to his original realm.
          Tyr was unable to comprehend what had happened and had forgotten how to function in his original world.
          words seemed very foreign to him and he found that even walking was difficult.
          Karel, realizing that Tyr had gone mad tried to help him in any way she could.<br>
          but he was too far gone. The insanity had completely gripped his mind. <br>
          with much grief, Karel sent Tyr to a mental institution, where hopefuly Tyr may one day gain his sanity.
          The Clinic for the Insane or Lame was not as kind as it seemed to Karel. There Tyr would be neglected,abused,
          tortured and forgotten. Tyr was eventually placed in isolation to reduce risk to himself and others.
          The time spent in there seemed again like aeons, furthuring his insanity.
          <br> With a great explosion, and screams and yells, tyrs isolation room burst forth revealing the outside world.
          <br> Without hessitation Tyr fled the Clinic, past the screams, explosions and blood, and into the forest.
